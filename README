                            RUNNING

Widget needs the following R packages installed:
* ggplot2
* maps
* brew
* colorspace
* gWidgets
* gWidgetsRGtk2

You can install them by running: 

install.packages(c("ggplot2", "maps", "brew", "colorspace", "gWidgets", 
                   "gWidgetsRGtk2" ))

Run the widget by executing PlotMaps.r script (remember to adjust the path). 
Widget is written for RGtk2. On Windows it will need GTK+ Runtime Environment 
installed, to be dowloaded for example here:
