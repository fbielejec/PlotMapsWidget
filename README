R Widget to support processing and visualizing BEAST's phylogeographic models.

Widget needs the following R packages installed:
* combinat
* ggplot2
* maps
* gWidgets
* gWidgetsRGtk2


Run it by executing PlotMaps.r script (remember to adjust the path). Widget is 
written for RGtk2 (probably not tcltk compliant, however I have not tested it).

# Add some jitter to labels positions to avoid overplotting (still not perfect)       
# Work on speedups (read.table, paralell computations )                                               
# Add output to kml option
# Dim lat/long fields if user chooses full globe coordinates                                  
# Save BF and I as numerical (change to factors in plot utilities )
# Add cancel current job functionality
# Coding convention: 
                                functions: large letter without underscores
                   variables, GUI objects: small letters with underscores
                   =        : when wrapped with another object or instruction/statement
                   <-       : standalone, updating status bar values
