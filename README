                        PlotMaps Widget v1.0

To be used & abused :)

________________________________________________________________________________
                            RUNNING

Widget needs the following R packages installed:
* combinat
* ggplot2
* maps
* gWidgets
* gWidgetsRGtk2


Run it by executing PlotMaps.r script (remember to adjust the path). Widget is 
written for RGtk2 (probably not tcltk compliant, however I have not tested it).

# Add some jitter to labels positions to avoid overplotting (still not perfect)                                                      
# Add output to kml option
