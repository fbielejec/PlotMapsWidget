                        PlotMaps Widget v1.0

To be used & abused :)

________________________________________________________________________________
                            RUNNING

Script needs the following R packages installed:
* ggplot2
* maps
* maptools
* rgdal
* gWidgets
* cairoDevice
* gWidgetsRGtk2


Run it by executing PlotMaps.r script (remember to adjust the path). Widget is written for RGtk2 (probably not tcltk compliant, however I have no tested it). I will work on removing rgdal dependency as installing it is quite space-hungry.

                            TODO
* Add support for other kml layers (ex points)
* Add "plot on whole globe" mode
* Text labels need more work
