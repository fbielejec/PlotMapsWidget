Widget needs the following R packages installed:
* combinat
* ggplot2
* maps
* gWidgets
* gWidgetsRGtk2


Run it by executing PlotMaps.r script (remember to adjust the path). Widget is 
written for RGtk2 (probably not tcltk compliant, however I have not tested it).

# Add some jitter to labels positions to avoid overplotting (still not perfect)                                                      
# Add output to kml option
# Dim lat/long fields if user chooses full globe coordinates

# TryCatch blocks for saving output
# Move svalues from gui to handlers 
# option to choose arrow tips (first, last, both, none)
