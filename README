                        PlotMaps Widget v1.0

To be used & abused :)

________________________________________________________________________________
                            RUNNING

Script needs the following R packages installed:
* ggplot2
* maps
* maptools
* rgdal
* gWidgets
* cairoDevice
* gWidgetsRGtk2


Run it by executing PlotMaps.r script (remember to adjust the path). Widget is written for RGtk2 (probably not tcltk compliant, however I have not tested it).

                            TODO
# Make it work in two modes: partial data, full globe
# Add more options (vertical, horizontal adjust, factor bins...)
# Supress all the warnings from rgdal::readOGR 
# add some jitter to labels positions to avoid overplotting (still not perfect)
# Work on looks and layout, currently its kinda ugly
